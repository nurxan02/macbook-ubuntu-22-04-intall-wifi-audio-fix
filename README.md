## Introduction

In 2025, I decided to give new life to my aging MacBook Pro 15" 2016 (model A1707, MacBookPro13,3) by switching from macOS to a fully Linux-based system. macOS support had ended, and I wanted up-to-date software and a stable system for my daily use. This article is my hands-on experience and practical guide for installing Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on this hardware‚Äîcomplete with step-by-step installation, driver fixes, and troubleshooting tips.

## 1. Downloading Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ISO

Although Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is now available, I specifically chose 22.04 LTS for maximum driver compatibility and long-term support.

**Download Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:**

- https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/
- [Main download page](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

I downloaded the ISO file to prepare a bootable USB.

## 2. Creating a Bootable USB

To make a bootable USB (at least 8GB), I used Balena Etcher:

## 3. Partitioning the Disk in macOS

Before installing, I used Disk Utility on macOS to make space for Ubuntu:

- I created an 81GB partition dedicated to Ubuntu.
- In Disk Utility, always choose **"Add Partition"** (not "Add Volume").
- Format as MS-DOS (FAT) for compatibility.

## 4. Booting from the USB Drive

With the Mac turned off, I plugged in the USB stick and held the **Option (‚å•)** key while powering on. In the boot menu, I selected the **"EFI Boot"** option to start Ubuntu.

## 5. Ubuntu Installation Steps

1. Selected language and keyboard layout.
2. Chose **"Try or Install Ubuntu"**.
3. On the disk partitioning screen, I picked **Manual/Custom (Something Else)**.
4. Located my previously created 81GB partition.
5. Set 1GB as swap and the rest as root (/) in ext4 format.
6. Started the installation and rebooted after it completed.

## 6. First Boot & Initial Problems

After installation, I again used the Option key to select EFI Boot for Ubuntu.
The system launched fine, but I immediately faced some hardware issues:

- ‚ùå Wi-Fi networks visible, but unable to connect (Only you can connect to mobile hotspot becaus they security protocol is so simple as WPA)
- ‚ùå No sound from speakers or microphone
- ‚ùå Touch Bar & FaceTime HD camera not working

## 7. Wi-Fi Issues and Solution

The built-in Broadcom Wi-Fi adapter on this MacBook is notorious for Linux compatibility problems. The device detected networks but refused to connect‚Äîan issue seen on many Dell, HP, and older MacBooks.

### Solution: Lowering TxPower Value

After much trial and error, I discovered that lowering the adapter's TxPower value fixed the problem. Here's what worked:

```bash
# Find your wireless adapter's name:
sudo iwconfig
# or
ip a

# Lower the TxPower (replace <adapter> with yours, e.g. wlan0, wlp3s0):
sudo iwconfig <adapter> txpower 10
```

> **Note:** Use your actual adapter name from the previous command.

With this, I could connect reliably to **2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks**.
‚ö†Ô∏è **5GHz Wi-Fi** still doesn't work with the Broadcom 43602 chip; I'll update this post if I find a workaround.

## 8. Fixing Audio (Speakers & Microphone)

Ubuntu does not natively support the Cirrus Logic CS8409 audio chip found in this MacBook.
I solved this by writing and publishing an open-source driver for the community.

### Open Source Driver & Installation

> **GitHub repository:**
> üîó https://github.com/nurxan02/snd-hda-codec-cirrus-logic-cs8409

Installation is straightforward:

```bash
# Install required build tools:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) git

# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nurxan02/snd-hda-codec-cirrus-logic-cs8409.git
cd snd-hda-codec-cirrus-logic-cs8409

# Build and install the driver:
make
sudo make install

# Reboot:
sudo reboot
```

üìñ See README.md for troubleshooting and advanced tips.

## 9. Remaining or Partially-Solved Issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Touch Bar:** Support is still very limited, mostly non-functional.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **FaceTime HD Camera:** Still working on a solution‚Äîwill update if/when it works.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5GHz Wi-Fi:** No solution yet for the Broadcom 43602 chip, stay tuned for updates.

## 10. Conclusion & Evaluation

It's absolutely possible to run a stable, fully usable Ubuntu 22.04 LTS desktop on a 2016 MacBook Pro (A1707), but you must be ready for extra tweaks, drivers, and manual fixes‚Äîespecially for audio and Wi-Fi.
